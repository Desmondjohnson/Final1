	   <details><summary>My Childhood </summary>
		   I grew up in Indianapolis,IN and I had a rough childhood only because of bad assosiation. I really learned my lesson and im glad that God led me through that the way he did or I would still be ignorant to bad association. My parents are Jehovahs witnesses and always raised me religiously. Tho I dont practice that faith, I put my faith God and Jesus Christ whole heartedly and am thankful for all the trials and tribulations I have been through to lead me to this point in my life.
